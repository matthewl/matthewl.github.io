      <h1>Creating your own assertions with Minitest</h1>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">Minitest</a> is a great testing framework for new and experienced programmers. With assertions limited to a number that makes them easier to recall it levels the playing field for new programmers allowing them to get up to speed in no time.</p>

<p>I very rarely have to use anything other than Minitest’s own set of assertions in my day to day work but every once in a while there’s an exception to this. It might be a number of assertions that could be refactored into one assertion or it could be a part of your code that requires a specific assertion that can’t be easily handled by Minitest’s own assertions.</p>

<p>Let’s look at such a case.</p>

<p>I’m using assertions to test the contents of an email I send. The email has templates for both plain test and HTML. At the moment, I’m testing each assertion on its own.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">assert_match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/Hi there </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">first_name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sr">/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mail</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">text_part</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_s</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">assert_match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/Hi there </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">first_name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sr">/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mail</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">html_part</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_s</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I have a few of these tests around my code for different emails that I am sending. The duplication of testing different templates of the email isn’t a major concern but it could certainly be tidied up. Wouldn’t it be nice to wrap these two assertions into one?</p>

<p>Minitest allows you to define your own assertions but up until this time I made do with Minitest and Rails’ own assertions. Adding your own assertions to Minitest is easily done.</p>

<p>I included the following assertion in my <em>test_helper</em> file but you can include your own assertions in a seperate file if you want to and then include that in your <em>test_helper</em> file using a <em>require</em>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Minitest::Assertions</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">assert_mail_match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expected</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">actual</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'text'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'html'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">mail_part</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">assert_match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expected</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">actual</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">mail_part</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">_part"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to_s</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What we’re doing is adding a wrapper around Mintest’s <em>assert_match</em> method and pass in our expected value and the actual value. The method will iterate over the two mail parts (in this case plain text and HTML) in the mailer and assert that each format has the correct corresponding content.</p>

<p>We can now call the new assertion in our tests:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">assert_mail_match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/Hi there </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">person</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">first_name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sr">/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mail</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Wrapping these two assertions into one makes sense. The template formats for the mailers are unlikely to change and the two different formats have the same content albeit with different formatting.</p>

<p>After a couple of years of using RSpec, Minitest has been a nice change to how I test the Rails applications I’m working on. Its syntax and single way of doing things means that I find it much easier to write tests with Minitest than I do with RSpec.</p>
